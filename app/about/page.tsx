        I first started coding on roblox selling scripts to people for money. Lua was a lot easier than javascript so I'm doing this to work on my js skills as well as help provide diagrams for tricky scientific concepts. As of the 27th of Jan, the entire foundation of the website has been coded by yours truly, but complex models such as 3 dimension ones and some nuclear equations have been outsourced via AI or online code-sharing websites such as github.
